// that doesn't work
// surprise
// nothing shows up

// imagine this is in the middle of an important feature in a big app

// imagine that

// imagine that now 

// this code is perfectly fine - AND DOES. NOT. WORK.
// CODE IS PROPER. DOES. NOT. WORK
// LITERALLY THAT.
// FFS.

// it's a feature. code is fine. big app that matters a lot. time is ticking. 
// do you see how frustrating it can be?

// can you see how frustrating that is? 
// how easily it can be frustrating?
// how annoying that is? 

// how it's BUGGED CODE, SOMETHING NOT WORKING WITH THE LANGUAGE PROBABLY?

// HOW YOU CHECK EVERYTHING - EVERYTHING MATCHES - EVERYTHING - CODE IS ALRIGHT - YET IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK!!!

// can you see that? 


// now

// can you notice why the code doesn't work?

// if you don't see it: 
// 1. start from line 1
// 2. go slowly to the end, then read it backwards, 2x
// 3. SLOWLY. CHECK YOURSELF. If you go faster, YOU WILL AUTOMATE THE SAME INTERPRETATION AND OMISSION AGAIN AND MISS IT.
// 4. repeat for all lines. 
// 5. enjoy staying calm and finding it soon.
